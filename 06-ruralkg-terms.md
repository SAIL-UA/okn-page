# RuralKG RDF Terms

*by the RuralKG Team â€¢ last updated September 22, 2025*

This page lists all classes (types of things) and properties (relationships) used in the **Rural Knowledge Graph (RuralKG)**. The graph integrates cross-domain data covering administrative geography, public health, and justice to study rural resilience in the United States.

Our modeling approach is to reuse established, standard vocabularies where possible and define custom terms only when necessary for our specific domain connections. This page is organized by namespace, with the standard, reused vocabularies listed first, followed by the custom terms created specifically for RuralKG.

## Standard Vocabularies (Reused Terms)

These terms are adopted from widely used, external ontologies to ensure our data is interoperable and follows FAIR principles.

### Schema.org (`schema`)
A general-purpose vocabulary for structured data. We use it primarily for geographic and organizational concepts.
* `schema:City`
* `schema:GeoCoordinates`
* `schema:Place`
* `schema:PostalAddress`
* `schema:address`
* `schema:addressLocality`
* `schema:addressRegion`
* `schema:geo`
* `schema:latitude`
* `schema:location`
* `schema:longitude`
* `schema:postalCode`

### Dublin Core (`dcterms`)
Used for metadata describing the RuralKG ontology itself.
* `dcterms:created`
* `dcterms:creator`
* `dcterms:hasVersion`
* `dcterms:title`

### RDF, RDFS, & OWL
Core vocabularies for defining the fundamental structure and semantics of the knowledge graph.
* `rdf:type`
* `rdfs:Class`
* `rdfs:subClassOf`
* `rdfs:label`
* `rdfs:comment`
* `rdfs:isDefinedBy`
* `owl:Ontology`
* `owl:imports`
* `owl:sameAs`

### Friend of a Friend (`foaf`)
Used for social networking concepts, from which we adopt the property for phone numbers.
* `foaf:phone`

* `adminArea:containsPlace` - An object property linking a larger administrative area (like a State) to a smaller one it contains (like a County).
* `adminArea:fips` - A literal property for the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code that uniquely identifies states and counties.
* `adminArea:primaryCounty` - An object property linking a `City` instance to its primary `County` instance.
